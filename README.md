- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AStarBaby
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the arts, philanthropy, business, entrepreneurship, investments and learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a recent graduate of Flatiron School's Data Analytics bootcamp. Not an easy process, but I thoroughly learning and using the different tools and systems to create things that are helpful and important. In addition to learning Python, SQLite, Matplotlib, Numpy, SciKit Learn, and JSON, we tapped into A/B testing and linear regression modeling. It was like someone else filling your plate for you and you, not wanting to disappoint, eating it all. Though you got too full, you also enjoyed everything, so can not be mad about anything.
